                    Cookies
                    <br>
                    By using Shellnet, you consent to the use of cookies. Most of the modern day interactive web sites
                    use cookies to enable us to retrieve user details for each visit.

                    <br>
                    Each address on Shellnet shares the same view key. Since it is possible to correlate the
                    transactions in a block to a specific TurtleCoin address, your transactions are not completely

                    You must not misuse our service by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or
                    other material which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain
                    unauthorised access to our service, the server on which our service is stored or any server,

                    viruses or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer
                    programs, data or other proprietary material due to your use of our service or to your downloading
